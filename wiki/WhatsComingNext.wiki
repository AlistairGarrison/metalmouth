The big question on the agenda is "what baseline level of support for HTML / WAI-ARIA items is needed in order to consider Project metalmouth a useful assistive technology for web content?"  

With an even bigger question to follow - "does such a baseline already exist, and if not would it be something other web content orientated screen-readers / voice browsers would be interested to explore / sign up to?"

In the meantime, the list of items on the to do list looks like this:

== -3) Refactoring code / Adoption of Google's Closure Library ==

This is underway - with initial source code for metalmouth + closure library integration found in svn/branches/metalmouth_closure_src...

Read the READ ME file to learn how to create the metalmouth-compiled.js and metalmouthInit-compiled.js files.

== 1) Re-implement Google TTS ==

== 2) Options button from toolbar - opens option page ==

Fine control for the tts. Also, the ability to turn on/off features under test.

== 3) Improve mode ==

Tells the user which parts of a page are missing i.e. "No page title defined", "missing skip link to main content".  This should allow people to better test their web content using this extension.

== 4) Overview function==

Provides an overview of the content on the page, and an indication of the layout of the page.  This feature can be switched on and off from the options page.

== 5) Support for certain WAI-ARIA items== 

== 6) Support for multiple select menus == 

== 7) Support for data lists == 

== 8) Iframes == 

== 9) Support for input type=file == 

If the url for a local file server has been provided metalmouth will be able to override the native file call and open a window showing the local file server contents.

== 10) Objects ==

== 11) MathML ==
