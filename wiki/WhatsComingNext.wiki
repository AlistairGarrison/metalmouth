The big question on the agenda is "what baseline level of support for HTML / WAI-ARIA items is needed in order to consider Project metalmouth a useful assistive technology for web content?"  

With an even bigger question to follow - "does such a baseline already exist, and if not would it be something other web content orientated screen-readers / voice browsers would be interested to explore / sign up to?"

In the meantime, the list of items on the to do list looks like this:

== -3) Refactoring code / Adoption of Google's Closure Library ==

This is underway - with initial source code for metalmouth + closure library integration found in svn/branches/metalmouth_closure_src...

Read the READ ME file to learn how to create the metalmouth-compiled.js and metalmouthInit-compiled.js files.

== -2) Re-implement Google TTS ==

== -1) Options button from toolbar - opens option page ==

==0) Support for certain WAI-ARIA items== 

==1) Support for multiple select menus == 

==2) Support for data lists == 

==3) Iframes == 

==4) Support for input type=file == 

==5) Objects ==

==6) Overview function==

On loading the page a user will hear an "overview" of the page layout.
