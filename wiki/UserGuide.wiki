=Project metalmouth extension user guide=

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

==Starting the extension in the Chrome browser==

With recent support for interaction with the extension from the Chrome browser's omnibox/url area two methods for starting the extension are possible.  Omnibox support was added due to a worry about how a user would navigate to the voice browser extension - as Chrome browser is not self-voicing (and, without the need for an external screen-reader).

=== Omnibox Method (Four key strokes only) ===

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.

  #  Press the m key twice.  (Reminder: Do not press enter yet as doing so will end up in a google search for 'mm').  The keyword 'mm' activates the extension.  When the extension is active it will ask you to "press the space bar and then press enter".
  #  Press the space bar.
  #  Press enter.  

The Project metalmouth extension will start - taking the user to the "http://www.google.com" web page and displaying the control panel.

=== Extension Button Method ===

  #  Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo) in the Chrome browser's toolbar.  

This method is not really intended for use by actual users.  It is doubtful that a user will be able to navigate to the button without voice - Chrome browser is not self-voicing - or, without the need for an external screen-reader.

==Flexible off-screen model==

===Quick overview===

Project metalmouth's off-screen model comprises of both static and interactable items which by and large reflect the state of the current GUI objects displayed on the screen.   

Static items allow web content to be repackaged into more cohesive blocks of semantic information - so that it can be better understood by vision impaired users. Interactable items, on the other hand, allow the way in which a user interacts with an HTML object to be changed to improve their user experience.

The off-screen model developed for Project metalmouth has been designed to work best with web content developed in accordance with relevant aspects of accessibility standards (first and foremost the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

===Items in the off-screen model===

If the (X)HTML code from which they are formed is present the following 'off-screen model' objects can be navigated to: 

  *  page header area;
  *  site navigation area;
  *  menu;
  *  menu item;
  *  main content area;
  *  page footer area;
  *  page contact details;
  *  skip link;
  *  skip target;
  *  link;
  *  text box;
  *  search box;
  *  password box;
  *  button;
  *  check button;
  *  single select (drop-down menu with one selectable option);
  *  section;
  *  paragraph;
  *  sentence;
  *  quote;
  *  quote link;
  *  insertion;
  *  deletion;
  *  code;
  *  form;
  *  input group;
  *  telephone box;
  *  url box;
  *  email box;
  *  number box;
  *  datetime box;
  *  date box;
  *  month box;
  *  week box;
  *  time box;
  *  range input;
  *  bulleted list;
  *  numbered list;
  *  list item;
  *  map;
  *  map area;
  *  data table;
  *  header cell; 
  *  data cell;
  *  audio;
  *  video;
  *  semantic image;
  *  decorative image;
  *  unsupported.  

The following items exist in the off-screen model but cannot be navigated to.

  *  static text;
  *  layout division;
  *  layout table;
  *  layout header cell;
  *  layout data cell;

===Interactable items in the off-screen model===

Not all items, however, can be interacted with - currently it is only:

  *  *skip link*: Interaction will move the user to the identified skip target.
  *  *link*: Interaction will direct the Chrome browser to the new location and reload the Project metalmouth extension.
  *  *quote link*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *map area*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *text box*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a text box, an 'Enter' button and a 'Cancel' button.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed. By pressing enter when the 'Enter' button is focused the value written in the text box will be transferred into the live text box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.  pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions. 
  *  *search box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *password box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *telephone box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *url box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *e-mail box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *number box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *datetime box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *date box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *month box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *week box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *time box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *button*: Interaction will click the live button corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.
  *  *check button*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'Check' button, an 'Uncheck' button and a Cancel button. By pressing enter when the 'Check' button is focused the value of the live check box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out will be changed to 'checked'.  The same is true for the 'Unchecked' button, although this will mean an 'unchecked' value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.
  *  *single select*: Interaction will open the interaction area which will contain buttons corresponding to each available option in the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.  A 'Cancel' button is also provided.  By pressing enter when one of these buttons is focused the value of the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out will be changed to that new value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.   
  *  *range input*: Interaction will open the interation area containing a 'increase value' button, a 'decrease value' button, an 'enter' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *audio*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'play' button, 'pause' button, 'rewind' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *video*: Interaction same as audio.

==Starting==

When a page is loaded the extension will automatically start to read out all the items in the off-screen model for the page (see later sections). 

==Extension Control Panel==

The control panel is displayed at the top of the page, just under Chrome browser's own controls (see highlighted area in the image below).

[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w1dXbXcgREU/TZrobmGvqAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/PI8nYIx9OQc/s1600/screenshotMetalmouth.png] 

A close-up of the control panel is shown below.  All functionality provided by the buttons and drop-down menus is explained in detail below.

===Overview===

  # *Back to start* button;
  # *Jump* button;
  # *Read previous item* button;
  # *Read next item* button;
  # *Interact* button;
  # *Read on* button;
  # *Stop reading* button;
  # *Change location* button;
  # *Navigate by* button;
  # *Options* button;

===Navigation - simple is best===

A user can start/resume reading on from their current position at any time by hitting space bar.
The extension can be stopped from reading all items by hitting the spacebar again. 

A user is able to use the up and down arrows at any time (even when the extension is reading) to navigate between items within a page, and within sub menus. If the current item is interactable a user simply needs to hit enter to start interacting.

In addition, by pressing the right arrow a user will jump down the page to each item of the type selected in the 'Navigate by' menu (see 'Navigate by' function).

===Hotkey support===

The control panel can be brought into focus at any time by using the access key 'c'.

  *  On windows this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On mac this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' and 'ctrl' keys and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On linux this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.

All the buttons are available via hot keys or tabbing. Buttons will be disabled when they are not needed, which means that they will not be able to be tabbed to.
 
Holding down the relevant hot key for a function for more than one second will bring the function's button into focus. The hot keys for the functions above have been arranged in order to centre the hands on the keyboard, along with the use of the space bar to activate the buttons. The most used options are nearest the centre of the keyboard.

Also, when in a sub menu a user can hold down the "esc" key to bring focus to the "close menu" button - very helpful when there are a large number of options.

The hope with the hot keys, and the changed control panel layout, is that less tabbing will be required for users.
----
===Read on===

====Expected outcome:====

The extension will read out each item in turn, starting from the current item.  The user can choose to continue to listen to the page being read out at anytime.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing the space bar; or 
  * holding down the hot key 'k', or by pressing the space bar when the 'Read on' button is focused.
----
===Stop reading===

====Expected outcome:====

The extension will stop reading out all items in turn.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing the space bar.
----
===Read next===

====Expected outcome:====

If available, the next item in the 'off-screen model' will be read out.

If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the Navigate by drop-down they will be take to the next item of this type.  If no next item exists this button will be disabled.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing the up arrow; or
  * holding down the hot key 'h' and pressing enter when the Read next button is focused.
----
===Read previous===

====Expected outcome:====

If available, the previous item in the 'off-screen model' will be read out.

If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the Navigate by drop-down they will be take to the previous item of this type.  If no previous item exists this button will be disabled.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing the up arrow; or
  * holding down the hot key 'g' and pressing enter when the Read previous button is focused.  
----

===Interact===

====Expected outcome:====

A user can interact with any item stated to be 'interactable'.
If the object which has just been read out cannot be interacted with the button will be disabled.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing enter (when the item is stated to be 'interactable'); or
  * holding down the hot key 'j' and pressing enter when the Interact button is focused.
----
===Jump===

====Expected outcome:====

As user is able to navigate directly to selected items by using the Jump function.  The default item is 'Section', however, by using the 'Navigate by' function (described later) a user can select other items - such as Link, Form, etc...

The user will be taken to the first item of the selected type, and with each further click to subsequent items in the page - one after another.

====Achieved by:====

  * pressing the right arrow; or
  * holding down the hot key 'f' and pressing enter when the Jump button is focused. 
----

===Back to start===

====Expected outcome:====

The user will be taken back to the start of the current page - with everything as it was when the Project metalmouth extension loaded.

====Achieved by:====

  * holding down the hot key 'd'; or
  * pressing enter when the Back to start button is focused.
----

===Change location button===

By holding down the hot key 'b', or by pressing enter when the 'Change location' button is focused, a sub-menu will be made available.  When this sub-menu has focus a user can tab through functions by which they can change the web page currently loaded in the Chrome browser.  

*Sub menu item - Back*

By pressing the space bar when the Back button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the previous url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.

*Sub menu item - New url*

By pressing the space bar when the New url button is focused a url entry area and go button will appear, with the text area gaining focus.

When the url entry area is focused a user can enter a url (which must include the http://, https://, etc...).  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

When a url has been entered a user can tab once to the Go button.  By pressing enter when the Go button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.
----

===Navigate by item===

By holding down the hot key 's', or by pressing the space bar when the 'Navigate by' button is focused, a sub-menu will be made available.  When this sub-menu has focus a user can tab through a set of items which they can choose to navigate the page by via the 'Jump' button.  

So far Project metalmouth supports navigation by section, form, link and skip link (more will follow in time).  It should be noted that the items in the Navigate by item sub-menu will only appear if content to which they relate can be located in the web content being browsed e.g. form will show in the drop-down if a form exists. 
----

===Options button===

By holding down the hot key 'l', or by pressing the space bar when the 'Options' button is focused, a sub-menu will be made available.  When this sub-menu has focus a user can tab through functions by which they can change certain settings in the Project metalmouth extension.  

*Sub menu item - Speak at slow speed*

(Currently does nothing - requires chrome.experimental.tts which has been temporarily removed)

By pressing the space bar when the 'Speak at slow speed' button is focused the user will change the speed of the voice pronouncing the text, in this case to a slow rate. 

*Sub menu item - Speak at normal speed*

Currently does nothing - requires chrome.experimental.tts which has been temporarily removed)

By pressing the space bar when the 'Speak at normal speed' button is focused the user will change the speed of the voice pronouncing the text, in this case to a normal rate. 

*Sub menu item - Speak at fast speed*

Currently does nothing - requires chrome.experimental.tts which has been temporarily removed)

By pressing the space bar when the 'Speak at fast speed' button is focused the user will change the speed of the voice pronouncing the text, in this case to a fast rate. 

So far Project metalmouth supports slow, normal, fast (more might follow in time). 

Project metalmouth automatically changes the pronunciation being used by the voice according to the specified page language i.e. if a page specified en-US the pronunciation should change correspondingly.  The experimental nature of Chrome's text-to-speech api means that this functionality at present does not appear to be working as intended.
