=Project metalmouth extension user guide=

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

==Starting the extension in the Chrome browser==

With recent support for interaction with the extension from the Chrome browser's omnibox/url area two methods for starting the extension are possible.  Omnibox support was added due to a worry about how a user would navigate to the voice browser extension - as Chrome browser is not self-voicing (and, without the need for an external screen-reader).

=== Omnibox Method (Four key strokes only) ===

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.

  #  Press the m key twice.  (Reminder: Do not press enter yet as doing so will end up in a google search for 'mm').  The keyword 'mm' activates the extension.  When the extension is active it will ask you to "press the space bar and then press enter".
  #  Press the space bar.
  #  Press enter.  

The Project metalmouth extension will start - taking the user to the "http://labs.google.com/accessible/" web page and displaying the control panel.

When the page is loaded the extension will read the page title, then automatically start to read out all the items in the off-screen model for the page (see later sections). 

=== Extension Button Method ===

  #  Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo) in the Chrome browser's toolbar.  

The Project metalmouth extension will start working with the current page. The extension will read the page title, then automatically start to read out all the items in the off-screen model for the page.

==Extension Control - Voice Commands==

===Turning on voice input=== 

===Using voice commands===

===Limitations===

The webkit-speech API, which the Project metalmouth extension utilises for speech input, is still under development.  It is for this reason that the voice input function is marked as experimental - requiring the user to turn it on in Project metalmouth's options. 

Several issues currently exist which degrade the usefulness of this API for people with visual disabilities - see [webkitSpeechAPIComments].

Limitations aside, it is without doubt that voice input will be increasingly important in the future for all users - especially those with disabilities.  It is hoped that Project metalmouth's early implementation of the webkit-speech API's will allow feedback to be provided to its developers regarding possible issues affecting people with visual disabilities.

==Extension Control - Keyboard==

The control panel is displayed at the top of the page, just under Chrome browser's own controls (see highlighted area in the image below).

The control panel contain two buttons (the change location button and the options button) and a display panel which serves only to show the item currently being read out.  

----

===Navigation mode - simple is best===

You automatically start off in "navigation mode".  In this mode a simple navigation mechanism is provided which allows movement between items in the off-screen model - details of all items (including interactable items) are provided in the "Off-screen model" section in the Appendix at the bottom of the page. 

You can enter "Navigation mode" at any time by using the access key 'c'.

  *  On windows this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On mac this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' and 'ctrl' keys and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On linux this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.

In addition, pressing the "esc" when the change location button is focused will take you back into "navigation mode".

Note: You must be in "navigation mode" for the following keys to work.

====Up/down arrow====

A user is able to use the up and down arrows at any time (even when the extension is reading) to navigate between items within a page. 

In sub menus, you can use the up and down arrows to move between items.  Whilst in a sub menu, a user can hold down the "esc" key to bring focus to the "close menu" button - very helpful when there are a large number of options.

====Space bar====

A user can start/resume reading all items from their current position at any time by hitting the space bar.
The extension can be stopped from reading at any time by hitting the space bar again. 

====Enter====

If the current item is interactable (the "interactable" keyword will be read out) a user simply needs to hit enter to start interacting.

====Left arrow====

A user is able to use the left arrow to be taken back to the start of the page.

====Right arrow====

A user is able to use the right arrow to cycle through headers in turn.  The first header will be read again after the last header has been read.

==== One tab ====

A single tab when in navigation mode brings the Change location button into focus.

==== Two tabs ====

Two tabs when in navigation mode brings the Options location button into focus.

----

===Change location===

A single tab when in navigation mode brings the Change location button into focus.  As mentioned above, pressing the "esc" when the change location button is focused will take you back into "navigation mode".

Pressing enter when the change location button is focused will cause a sub-menu to be shown. 

This change location sub-menu holds two options a user can arrow through which allow the location of web page currently loaded in the browser to be changed.  

*Sub menu option 1 - Back*

By pressing enter when the Back button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the previous url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.

*Sub menu option 2 - New url*

By pressing enter when the New url button is focused a url entry area and go button will appear, with the text area gaining focus.

When the url entry area is focused a user can enter a url (which must include the http://, https://, etc...).  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

When a url has been entered a user can tab once to the Go button.  By pressing enter when the Go button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.
----

=== Options ===

Two tabs when in navigation mode brings the Options location button into focus.  As mentioned above, pressing the "esc" when the change option button is focused will take you back into "navigation mode".

Pressing enter when the options button is focused will cause the browser to take you to the options page.

In the options page, features of metalmouth and the chrome text-to-speech engine can be altered.  To save the values you have set click the save and close button (bottom of the page) - this will take you back to the page you were looking at prior to selecting options.

==Appendix==

===Off-screen model===

Project metalmouth's off-screen model comprises of both static and interactable items which reflect the state of the current GUI objects displayed on the screen.   

Static items allow web content to be repackaged into more cohesive blocks of semantic information - so that it can be better understood by vision impaired users. Interactable items allow the way in which a user interacts with an HTML object to be changed to improve user experience.

The off-screen model developed for Project metalmouth has been designed to work best with web content developed in accordance with relevant aspects of accessibility standards (first and foremost the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

If the (X)HTML code from which they are formed is present, the following 'off-screen model' objects can be navigated to: 

  *  page header area;
  *  site navigation area;
  *  menu;
  *  menu item;
  *  main content area;
  *  page footer area;
  *  page contact details;
  *  skip link;
  *  skip target;
  *  link;
  *  text box;
  *  search box;
  *  password box;
  *  button;
  *  check button;
  *  single select (drop-down menu with one selectable option);
  *  static text;
  *  level 1 - 6 headers; 
  *  section;
  *  paragraph;
  *  sentence;
  *  quote;
  *  quote link;
  *  insertion;
  *  deletion;
  *  code;
  *  form;
  *  input group;
  *  telephone box;
  *  url box;
  *  email box;
  *  number box;
  *  datetime box;
  *  date box;
  *  month box;
  *  week box;
  *  time box;
  *  range input;
  *  bulleted list;
  *  numbered list;
  *  list item;
  *  map;
  *  map area;
  *  data table;
  *  header cell; 
  *  data cell;
  *  audio;
  *  video;
  *  canvas;
  *  semantic image.

Some of these items can also be interacted with:

  *  *skip link*: Interaction will move the user to the identified skip target.
  *  *link*: Interaction will direct the Chrome browser to the new location and reload the Project metalmouth extension.
  *  *quote link*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *map area*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *text box*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a text box, an 'Enter' button and a 'Cancel' button.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed. By pressing enter when the 'Enter' button is focused the value written in the text box will be transferred into the live text box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out.  pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions. 
  *  *search box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *password box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *telephone box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *url box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *e-mail box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *number box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *datetime box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *date box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *month box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *week box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *time box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *button*: Interaction will click the live button corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.
  *  *check button*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'Check' button, an 'Uncheck' button and a Cancel button. By pressing enter when the 'Check' button is focused the value of the live check box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out will be changed to 'checked'.  The same is true for the 'Unchecked' button, although this will mean an 'unchecked' value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.
  *  *single select*: Interaction will open the interaction area which will contain buttons corresponding to each available option in the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out.  A 'Cancel' button is also provided.  By pressing enter when one of these buttons is focused the value of the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out will be changed to that new value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.   
  *  *range input*: Interaction will open the interation area containing a 'increase value' button, a 'decrease value' button, an 'enter' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *audio*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'play' button, 'pause' button, 'rewind' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *video*: Interaction same as audio.
