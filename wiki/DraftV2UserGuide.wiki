=Project metalmouth extension user guide=

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

==Recommendation: Use a headset==

It is strongly recommended to use a headset (headphones + microphone), both with regard to information security and when giving voice commands as the sensitivity of the voice input area means it's accuracy is negatively affected by ambient noise.  In addition, Project metalmouth's 'speak now' addition (required for people with visual disabilities) can also be picked up by the voice input - something which does not happen if a headset is used. 

----

==Starting the extension==

Upon installation the metalmouth extension is automatically turned off.  To use the extension it must be turned on. Two methods exist for turning on the extension, the omnibox method and button method.  In addition, once the metalmouth extension is turned on, a new option "always-on" is available for permanently keeping it on. 

===Omnibox Method (Now only two key strokes)===

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.

  #  Press the m key twice.  The keyword 'mm' activates the extension.

The Project metalmouth extension will turn on - saying "starting metalmouth extension". Please read "Extension on" below.

===Extension Button Method===

  #  Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo - with mouth closed) in the Chrome browser's toolbar.  

The Project metalmouth extension will turn on - saying "starting metalmouth extension". Please read "Extension on" below.

===If always-on option selected===

As mentioned an new option is available to permanently keep the metalmouth extension turned on - called "always-on".  If this option is selected the omnibox and button start methods, of course, no longer function.  This option can be turned on or off at any time via the options page.

----

==Extension on==

As soon as the metalmouth extension is turned on the metalmouth icon, visible in the Chrome Browser tool bar (fig 1), changes from having a closed mouth (fig 2) to having an open mouth (fig 3).

==Support for Chrome tabs==

The metalmouth extension allows for multi-tab voice browsing.  You are free to use Chrome's own shortcuts for opening new tabs and closing existing tabs.  Changing the url of a tab will be covered later.  In case you don't yet know Chrome's shortcuts, please find below a mini-guide.

  # Focusing the omnibar (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+L or Mac: ⌘-L). 
  # Create a new tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+T or Mac: ⌘-T).
  # Close the current (selected) tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+W or Mac: ⌘-W).
  # Cycle from the current (selected) tab to another tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+Tab or Mac: Ctrl-Tab).

----

==Extension Control - Keyboard==

To open metalmouth's top menu simply press the tab key.  The top menu bar will then appear at the top of the current tab, just under Chrome browser's own controls (fig 4).

Fig 4.

[https://sites.google.com/site/projectmetalmouth/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-12%20at%2016.59.41.png]

The control panel contain three buttons - the Change location button, Options button and Close menu button.  The Change location button has focus when the top menu bar is opened.

Pressing enter when the Change location button is focused will cause a sub-menu to be shown.
Pressing enter when the Options button is focused will open the metalmouth extension options page to open in a new tab.
To close the top menu bar either arrow down to, and click, the close menu button or press ESC.

----

===Change location menu===

This change location sub-menu (fig 5) holds three options a user can arrow through which allow the location of web page currently loaded in the browser to be changed or a url in a new tab to be opened.  

Fig 5.

[https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2009.37.00.png]

====Previous url====

By pressing enter when the Back button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the previous url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.

====Change url====

Pressing enter when the Change url button is focused opens the 'Change url entry area' (fig 6), with the text box in this area gaining focus.

Fig 6.

[https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png]

A user can enter a url (which must include the http://, https://, etc...) into this text box.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

When a url has been entered a user can use the down arrow to focus the Go button.  By pressing enter when the Go button is focused the url location of the current tab will be updated to the newly inputted url.  Once the page has loaded the metalmouth extension will, as usual, start to read all items.

====New tab====

Pressing enter when the New tab button is focused opens the 'New tab url entry area' (fig 7), with the text box in this area gaining focus.

Fig 7.

[https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png]

The process for entering a url is exactly the same as for changing a url, only this time a new tab will be created when the 'Go' button is focused and pressed.

----

===Options===

The options page features all metalmouth options which can be customised - currently:

  * New tab page option
  * Speech rate option
  * Always-on option
  * Voice input option (experimental)

Each of these options is covered in more detail below.

To save the values you have set click the save and close button (bottom of the page) - this will take you back to the page you were looking at prior to selecting options. 

====New tab page option====

When a new tab is opened the metalmouth extension will automatically update its contents to show "Google's Accessible Search" page.  If another url is desired by the user they simply need to enter the url into the text box input provided next to this option.

====Speech rate option====

On Windows / Chrome the speech rate for Chrome's Text-To-Speech engine can be adjusted using the provided range input - selecting a low value will make metalmouth read out content more slowly.

On Intel Macs an [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=99116 known issue] with Chromium / Chrome Text-To-Speech engine has caused unexpected crashes to Chrome, so another Text-To-Speech engine is being used instead.  Sadly this other Text-To-Speech engine does not have a changeable rate option - so on a Mac this option has been temporarily been disabled.    

====Always-on option====

This new option allows a user to select, via a checkbox, to keep the metalmouth extension permanently turned on. If this option is selected the omnibox and button start methods, of course, no longer function.

====Voice input option (experimental)====

On the options page a collection of items marked 'Experimental Features' can be found - containing the 'turn on voice input' option.

As voice input for Project metalmouth is experimental the user needs to select to turn it on before they can use it. 

Select the 'turn on voice input' option if you want to try controlling the Project metalmouth extension using voice commands - remembering to save and close the options page using the 'save & close' button.

----

===In-Tab Navigation mode - simple is best===

You automatically start off in "navigation mode".  In this mode a simple in-page navigation mechanism is provided (detailed directly below) which allows movement between items in the off-screen model - details of all items (including interactable items) are provided in the "Off-screen model" section in the Appendix at the bottom of the page. 

You will only leave 'navigation mode' when you are navigating within a menu or interaction area - in which case the in-page navigation mechanism will be suspended.

====Up/down arrow====

A user is able to use the up and down arrows at any time (even when the extension is reading) to navigate between items within a page. 

In sub menus, you can use the up and down arrows to move between items.  Whilst in a sub menu, a user can hold down the "esc" key to bring focus to the "close menu" button - very helpful when there are a large number of options.

====Space bar====

A user can start/resume reading all items from their current position at any time by hitting the space bar.
The extension can be stopped from reading at any time by hitting the space bar again. 

====Enter====

If the current item is interactable (the "interactable" keyword will be read out) a user simply needs to hit enter to start interacting.  Interaction is achieved via interaction areas - customised for the specific needs of the action being under taken i.e. inputting text, controlling a video, etc... For details on each of the interaction areas see the Interaction areas section below.

====Left arrow====

A user is able to use the left arrow to be taken back to the start of the page.

====Right arrow====

A user is able to use the right arrow to cycle through headers in turn.  The first header will be read again after the last header has been read.

==Extension Control - Experimental Voice Commands==

===Limitations===

The [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html HTML5 Speech Input API], Google's implementation of which the Project metalmouth extension utilises for speech input, is still under development.  It is for this reason that the voice input function is marked as experimental - requiring the user to turn it on in Project metalmouth's options. 

Several issues currently exist which degrade the usefulness of this API for people with visual disabilities - see [webkitSpeechAPIComments].

Limitations aside, it is without doubt that voice input will be increasingly important in the future for all users - especially those with disabilities.  It is hoped that Project metalmouth's early implementation of the webkit-speech API's will allow feedback to be provided to its developers ([http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html HTML5 Speech Input API]) regarding possible issues affecting people with visual disabilities.

===Using voice commands===

If the option to 'turn on voice input' has been selected the next time the Project metalmouth control panel appears a voice input area will have been added as its first item (see image).  

Fig 14.


The voice input can be operated in two ways - via the mouse or via the keyboard, using shortkeys.

Using the mouse: click on the microphone inside the voice input area and, after the 'speak now', speak the voice command (see Voice Commands).

Using the keyboard: When the voice input is focused use the following shortkeys (from [http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1407892]) - Ctrl+Shift+. (period) (Mac: ⌘-Shift-. (period)).

Note: On the Mac under some circumstances the shortkeys do not appear to work - an issue has been raised with the Chromium Developers [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97902].  

As mentioned earlier, there are still several limitations for a person with a visual disability to use this voice input - visit [webkitSpeechAPIComments] and see if you can add more... 

===Voice commands===

Saying the following single words will execute the following commands:

   * 'all' - Reads out all items;
   * 'next' - Reads out the next item;
   * ''previous' - Reads out the previous item;
   * 'do' - Interact with the current item;
   * 'stop' - Stop reading out all items.
   * 'continue' - Continue to read out all items from the current position;
   * 'jump' - Jump to the next heading;
   * 'options' - Opens the options page;
   * 'location' - Opens the navigation sub-menu.

More and more use of the Speech Input API is planned, along with a change to the control panel which will aid both voice and keyboard users...

==Appendix==

===Off-screen model===

Project metalmouth's off-screen model comprises of both static and interactable items which reflect the state of the current GUI objects displayed on the screen.   

Static items allow web content to be repackaged into more cohesive blocks of semantic information - so that it can be better understood by vision impaired users. Interactable items allow the way in which a user interacts with an HTML object to be changed to improve user experience.

The off-screen model developed for Project metalmouth has been designed to work best with web content developed in accordance with relevant aspects of accessibility standards (first and foremost the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

If the (X)HTML code from which they are formed is present, the following 'off-screen model' objects can be navigated to: 

  *  page header area;
  *  site navigation area;
  *  menu;
  *  menu item;
  *  main content area;
  *  page footer area;
  *  page contact details;
  *  skip link;
  *  skip target;
  *  link;
  *  text box;
  *  search box;
  *  password box;
  *  button;
  *  check button;
  *  single select (drop-down menu with one selectable option);
  *  static text;
  *  level 1 - 6 headers; 
  *  section;
  *  paragraph;
  *  sentence;
  *  quote;
  *  quote link;
  *  insertion;
  *  deletion;
  *  code;
  *  form;
  *  input group;
  *  telephone box;
  *  url box;
  *  email box;
  *  number box;
  *  datetime box;
  *  date box;
  *  month box;
  *  week box;
  *  time box;
  *  range input;
  *  bulleted list;
  *  numbered list;
  *  list item;
  *  map;
  *  map area;
  *  data table;
  *  header cell; 
  *  data cell;
  *  audio;
  *  video;
  *  canvas;
  *  semantic image.

Some of these items can also be interacted with:

  *  *skip link*: Interaction will move the user to the identified skip target.
  *  *link*: Interaction will direct the Chrome browser to the new location and reload the Project metalmouth extension.
  *  *quote link*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *map area*: Interaction same as link.
  *  *text box*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a text box, an 'Enter' button and a 'Cancel' button.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed. By pressing enter when the 'Enter' button is focused the value written in the text box will be transferred into the live text box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out.  pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions. 
  *  *search box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *password box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *telephone box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *url box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *e-mail box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *number box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *datetime box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *date box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *month box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *week box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *time box*: Interaction same as text box.
  *  *button*: Interaction will click the live button corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.
  *  *check button*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'Check' button, an 'Uncheck' button and a Cancel button. By pressing enter when the 'Check' button is focused the value of the live check box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out will be changed to 'checked'.  The same is true for the 'Unchecked' button, although this will mean an 'unchecked' value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.
  *  *single select*: Interaction will open the interaction area which will contain buttons corresponding to each available option in the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out.  A 'Cancel' button is also provided.  By pressing enter when one of these buttons is focused the value of the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' item which was read out will be changed to that new value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.   
  *  *range input*: Interaction will open the interation area containing a 'increase value' button, a 'decrease value' button, an 'enter' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *audio*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'play' button, 'pause' button, 'rewind' button and a 'close menu' button.
  *  *video*: Interaction same as audio.
