(It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.)

==Starting the extension in the Chrome browser==

With recent support for interaction with the extension from the Chrome browser's omnibox/url area two methods for starting the extension are possible.  Omnibox support was added due to a worry about how a user would navigate to the voice browser extension - as Chrome browser is not self-voicing (and, without the need for an external screen-reader).

=== Extension Button Method ===
