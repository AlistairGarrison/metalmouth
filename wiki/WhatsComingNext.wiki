The big question on the agenda is "what baseline level of support for HTML / WAI-ARIA items is needed in order to consider Project metalmouth a useful assistive technology for web content?"  

With an even bigger question to follow - "does such a baseline already exist, and if not would it be something other web content orientated screen-readers / voice browsers would be interested to explore / sign up to?"

In the meantime, the list of items on the to do list looks like this:

== 0) HTML5 Speech Control ==

== 1) Support for certain WAI-ARIA items / HTML5 elements == 

Also, using SSML markup to emphasis aspects of the off-screen model items.

== 2) Support for multiple select menus == 

== 3) Support for multi-select boxes and data lists == 

== 4) Iframes == 

== 5) Support for input type=file == 

If the url for a local file server has been provided metalmouth will be able to override the native file call and open a window showing the local file server contents.

== 6) Objects ==

== 7) MathML ==
