==Try to handle DOM Mutation Events in an elegant manner==

If nodes are added / removed from the DOM structure the user needs to be informed.  Concentration would initially be placed into the following three DOM mutation events:

  * DOMSubtreeModified (onsubtreemodified): Fires when the subtree is modified (bubbles)

  * DOMNodeInserted (onnodeinserted): Fires when a node has been added as a child of another node (bubbles)

  * DOMNodeRemoved (onnoderemoved): Fires when a node has been removed from a DOM-tree (bubbles)
