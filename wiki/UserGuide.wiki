=Project metalmouth extension user guide=

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

==Starting the extension in the Chrome browser==

With recent support for interaction with the extension from the Chrome browser's omnibox/url area two methods for starting the extension are possible.  Omnibox support was added due to a worry about how a user would navigate to the voice browser extension - as Chrome browser is not self-voicing (and, without the need for an external screen-reader).

=== Omnibox Method (Four key strokes only) ===

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.

  #  Press the m key twice.  The keyword 'mm' activates the extension. The extension will ask you to "press the space bar and then press enter".
  #  Press the space bar.
  #  Press enter.  

The Project metalmouth extension will start - taking the user to the "http://www.google.com" web page and displaying the control panel.

=== Extension Button Method ===

  #  Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo) in the Chrome browser's toolbar.  

This method is not really intended for use by actual users.  It is doubtful that a user will be able to navigate to the button without voice - Chrome browser is not self-voicing - or, without the need for an external screen-reader.

==Extension Control Panel==

The control panel is displayed at the top of the page, just under Chrome browser's own controls (see highlighted area in the image below).

The control panel can be brought into focus at any time by using the access key 'c'.

  *  On windows an accesskey is called by pressing and 'c'.
  *  On mac an accesskey is called by pressing and 'c'.
  *  On linux an accesskey is called by pressing and 'c'.

All buttons and drop-downs are then accessible by tabbing.  Buttons will be disabled when they are not needed, which means that they will not be able to be tabbed to.

A close-up of the control panel is shown below.  All functionality provided by the buttons and drop-down menus is explained in detail below.
