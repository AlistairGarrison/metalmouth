==1) Dynamic areas / Try to handle DOM Mutation Events in an elegant manner==

Many pages contain dynamic areas in which certain content is revolved or in which content is updated - in either case the Project metalmouth extension needs to know what is happening so the user can be informed.

So, research will be undertaken into either:

  # creating an item ("DynamicArea") in the off-screen model which can be used to represent a "dynamic area"; or
  # marking each off-screen model item that forms a dynamic area as "dynamicArea".  

Dynamic areas can then be handled accordingly.

If nodes are added / removed from the DOM structure the user needs to be informed.  So, efforts will also be placed into how best to implement the following three DOM mutation events:

  * DOMSubtreeModified (onsubtreemodified): Fires when the subtree is modified (bubbles)

  * DOMNodeInserted (onnodeinserted): Fires when a node has been added as a child of another node (bubbles)

  * DOMNodeRemoved (onnoderemoved): Fires when a node has been removed from a DOM-tree (bubbles)

==2) Moving toward a more complete off-screen model...==
