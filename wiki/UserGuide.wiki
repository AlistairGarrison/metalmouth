=Project metalmouth extension user guide=

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

==Starting the extension in the Chrome browser==

With recent support for interaction with the extension from the Chrome browser's omnibox/url area two methods for starting the extension are possible.  Omnibox support was added due to a worry about how a user would navigate to the voice browser extension - as Chrome browser is not self-voicing (and, without the need for an external screen-reader).

=== Omnibox Method (Four key strokes only) ===

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.

  #  Press the m key twice.  The keyword 'mm' activates the extension. The extension will ask you to "press the space bar and then press enter".
  #  Press the space bar.
  #  Press enter.  

The Project metalmouth extension will start - taking the user to the "http://www.google.com" web page and displaying the control panel.

=== Extension Button Method ===

  #  Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo) in the Chrome browser's toolbar.  

This method is not really intended for use by actual users.  It is doubtful that a user will be able to navigate to the button without voice - Chrome browser is not self-voicing - or, without the need for an external screen-reader.
----
==Extension Control Panel==

The control panel is displayed at the top of the page, just under Chrome browser's own controls (see highlighted area in the image below).

The control panel can be brought into focus at any time by using the access key 'c'.

  *  On windows this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On mac this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' and 'ctrl' keys and pressing the 'c' key.
  *  On linux this accesskey is called by holding down the 'alt' key and pressing the 'c' key.

All buttons and drop-downs are then accessible by tabbing.  Buttons will be disabled when they are not needed, which means that they will not be able to be tabbed to.

A close-up of the control panel is shown below.  All functionality provided by the buttons and drop-down menus is explained in detail below.

  #  Url entry area;
  # Go button;
  #  Back button;
  #  Navigate by item drop-down (available items: all, section, form, link, skip link);
  # Read again button;
  #  Read previous item button;
  #  Read next item button;
  #  Interact button;
  #  Speaking rate drop-down (available items: slow, normal, fast);

===Url entry area===

When the url entry area is focused a user can enter a url (which must include the http://, https://, etc...).  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

===Go===

When a url has been entered a user can tab once to the Go button.  By pressing enter when the Go button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.

===Back===

By pressing enter when the Back button is focused the Chrome browser will be directed to the previous url and the Project metalmouth extension will reload.  The user will then be focused back into the control panel.

===Navigate by item===

When this drop-down has focus a user can press enter and the tab through a set of items which they can choose to navigate the page by.  So far Project metalmouth supports navigation by all, section, form, link and skip link (more will follow in time).  It should be noted that, other than the 'all' option, the options in the Navigate by item drop-down will only appear if content to which they relate can be located in the web content being browsed e.g. form will show in the drop-down if a form exists.

When 'all' is selected all objects can be navigated to one by one - this would include the following 'off-screen model' object types: 

  *  skip link;
  *  skip target;
  *  link;
  *  text box;
  *  button;
  *  check button;
  *  single select (drop-down menu with one selectable option);
  *  section;
  *  paragraph;
  *  static text;
  *  form;
  *  semantic image;
  *  unsupported.   

===Read again===

By pressing enter when the Read again button is focused the object which has just been read out will be read out again.   

===Read previous===

By pressing enter when the Read previous button is focused the previous object in the 'off-screen model' will be read out.  If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the Navigate by drop-down they will be take to the previous object of this type.  If no previous object exists this button will be disabled.

===Read next===

By pressing enter when the Read next button is focused the next object in the 'off-screen model' will be read out.  If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the Navigate by drop-down they will be take to the next object of this type.  If no next object exists this button will be disabled.

===Interact===

By pressing enter when the Interact button is focused the object which has just been read out can be interacted with.  Not all objects, however, can be interacted with - currently it is only:

  *  *skip link*: Interaction will move the user to the identified skip target.
  *  *link*: Interaction will direct the Chrome browser to the new location and reload the Project metalmouth extension.
  *  *text box*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a text box, an 'Enter' button and a 'Cancel' button.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed. By pressing enter when the 'Enter' button is focused the value written in the text box will be transferred into the live text box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.  pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions. 
  *  *button*: Interaction will click the live button corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.
  *  *check button*: Interaction will open the interaction area containing a 'Check' button, an 'Uncheck' button and a Cancel button. By pressing enter when the 'Check' button is focused the value of the live check box corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out will be changed to 'checked'.  The same is true for the 'Unchecked' button, although this will mean an 'unchecked' value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.
  *  *single select*: Interaction will open the interaction area which will contain buttons corresponding to each available option in the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.  A 'Cancel' button is also provided.  By pressing enter when one of these buttons is focused the value of the live drop-down menu corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out will be changed to that new value. By pressing enter when the 'Cancel' button the interaction area will close with not further actions.   

If the object which has just been read out cannot be interacted with the button will be disabled.

===Speaking rate===

When this drop-down has focus a user can press enter and the tab through a set of speaking rates which they can choose.  So far Project metalmouth supports slow, normal, fast (more will follow in time). 

Project metalmouth automatically changes the pronunciation being used by the voice according to the specified page language i.e. if a page specified en-US the pronunciation should change correspondingly.  The experimental nature of Chrome's text-to-speech api means that this functionality at present does not appear to be working as intended. 

===Read from start===

By pressing enter when the 'Read from start' button is focused the Project metalmouth extension will start automatically reading the contents of the page from the start.  If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the 'Navigate by drop-down' they will be read out-loud objects of the selected type one-by-one. 

===Continue reading===

By pressing enter when the 'Continue' button is focused the Project metalmouth extension will start automatically reading the contents of the page from the object which has just been read out.  If a user has selected an option other than 'all' in the 'Navigate by drop-down' they will be read out-loud objects of the selected type one-by-one. The 'Continue' button is disabled until the 'Stop' button is pressed.

===Stop reading===

By pressing enter when the 'Stop' button is focused the Project metalmouth extension will stop automatically reading the contents of the page.  The 'Stop' button is disabled until either the 'Read from start' button or the 'Continue' button is pressed.
